It’s no secret to people who know me that I don’t really care for cars. It’s not the cars fault.. it was a fine invention and all but they just bring out the worst in people. 
Today on the local supermarket lot an SUV parked on two spots. I was told „otherwise people dent my 150k€ car“. 
Ok Boomer…
