So … I'm not a religious person really but I can totally appreciate that different people believe in different views of the world. 

I'm more comfortable with the whole "science can explain it all, and if it can't then we just didn't understand that thing yet" side of things.

BUT … sometimes … I really do stop and wonder, because some things happen that are just a little too crazy to be a coincidence … anyone else know that feeling?

In those situations I feel like there's a WHOLE bunch of stuff we did not yet discover and that it will be very very VERY interesting once we do 🙂‍↕️. 

Till then: Thank you universe! 🌌
