Today marks the last day of work for our little agency Dinghy. For this year of course. We‚Äôll absolutely be around next year! 

And that sorta leads me over to the main point here: we‚Äôre going to be around next year. And that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm really proud of. 

We‚Äôve started this journey around 3 years ago, back then my 2 cofounders and myself. 
This year one of my cofounders decided to go into another direction, which was a hard truth to swallow but also really necessary for all parties involved for a whole bunch of reasons. 

In those 3 years we had our ups and downs of course and just today I remembered a story my cofounder Dan told me about there being no long term success without the initial struggle‚Ä¶

Now I don‚Äôt wanna jinx things and I‚Äôm sure many entrepreneurs before me made the mistake i am about to make in a second here ‚Äî but I don‚Äôt really care right now! :) 

So! It feels to me that we made it - at least through our first batch of suffering and through a really tough year- and are looking at an open see of opportunities in 2025. 

I know that there‚Äôs whole bunch of problems in the world right now but if I may focus on just our teeny tiny accomplishment over here for second: 

I‚Äôm massively proud of our little team, of how we stuck together through good and bad and came out the other end in one piece. 

Gotta say, it‚Äôs much more exciting to start a business than I ever had anticipated but also much more exhilarating when it works out ü´†.

To anyone out there reading this thinking about starting shop: please try, it‚Äôs so worth it! 

But do believe people around you shying away from the massive invest it‚Äôll take from you. Because it absolutely will ü•π‚ò∫Ô∏è.

Happy holidays and to taking charge!
